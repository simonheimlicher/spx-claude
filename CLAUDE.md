# SPX-Claude Plugin Marketplace

Simon Heimlicher's Claude Code plugin marketplace, based on the spec-driven development framework [SPX](https://spx.sh).

## Marketplace Is a Product

We develop the “features” of this market place like a software product. We are currently starting out from scratch, so there is not yet much to be found, but as we progress, everything will be in `specs` and `docs`.

## Always use `AskUserQuestion` Tool

**Always use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to obtain guidance from the user, such as: discover context, obtain rationale, as well as to support the user in makking the right call by asking critical questions before blindly following the user's requests**

**NEVER ask the user any questions without using the `AskUserQuestion` tool**

## Version Management

### Versioning Rules (Conservative Approach)

All plugins follow semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

**MAJOR version (0.x.x → 1.x.x):**

- ⛔ **NEVER bump unless user explicitly requests it**
- All plugins remain at major version `0` until stable release
- Reserved for future stable release when all features are production-ready

**MINOR version (0.3.x → 0.4.x):**

- ✅ Adding new commands (e.g., new `/pickup` command)
- ✅ Adding new skills (e.g., new `/designing-frontend` skill)
- ✅ Major functional changes (e.g., atomic claim mechanism in `/pickup`)
- ✅ Significant user experience improvements
- 🎯 **Use sparingly** - only for substantial additions or changes

**PATCH version (0.3.1 → 0.3.2):**

- ✅ **Most common** - default for most changes
- ✅ Bug fixes
- ✅ Refactoring existing code
- ✅ Documentation improvements
- ✅ Small enhancements to existing features
- ✅ Performance optimizations
- ✅ Internal implementation changes
- 🎯 **Use liberally** - when in doubt, use PATCH

### Files to Update When Bumping Version

**Plugin version** (always update):

```bash
plugins/{plugin-name}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
```

```json
{
  "name": "claude",
  "version": "0.4.0" // ← Update this
}
```

**Marketplace catalog** (optional, only if description changes):

```bash
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json
```

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "claude",
      "source": "./plugins/claude",
      "description": "..." // ← Only update if description changes
    }
  ]
}
```

### Version Bump Examples

| Change                      | Old   | New   | Reason                          |
| --------------------------- | ----- | ----- | ------------------------------- |
| Add `/handoff` command      | 0.2.0 | 0.3.0 | New command = MINOR             |
| Add self-organizing handoff | 0.3.0 | 0.4.0 | Major functional change = MINOR |
| Fix typo in handoff.md      | 0.4.0 | 0.4.1 | Documentation fix = PATCH       |
| Refactor pickup logic       | 0.4.1 | 0.4.2 | Refactoring = PATCH             |
| Improve error messages      | 0.4.2 | 0.4.3 | Small enhancement = PATCH       |
| Add `/designing-frontend`   | 0.4.3 | 0.5.0 | New skill = MINOR               |

## Skill Organization Principles

### Foundational + Language-Specific Pattern

Skills follow a **reference pattern** to avoid duplication:

1. **Foundational skill** (`/testing`) - Contains core principles, methodology, and language-agnostic patterns
2. **Language-specific skills** (`/testing-python`, `/testing-typescript`) - Reference the foundational skill, provide only language-specific implementations

**Usage:** Always read the foundational skill first, then the language-specific skill for concrete patterns.

### Why This Pattern?

- **Single source of truth** - Core principles live in one place
- **No drift** - Changes to methodology propagate automatically
- **Focused content** - Each skill contains only what's unique to it
- **Maintainability** - Less duplication means less divergence over time

### Skill Invocation

Claude Code skills cannot automatically invoke other skills. However, skills can:

1. Instruct the AI to read another skill file first
2. Reference foundational concepts by skill name
3. Be invoked sequentially by the user/AI

## Test Plugin (`/testing`)

The test plugin provides BDD testing methodology with three-tier testing:

| Level          | Question                               | Requirements                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1: Unit        | "Is our logic correct?"                | Dependency injection, NO mocking |
| 2: Integration | "Does it work with real dependencies?" | Documented test harnesses        |
| 3: E2E         | "Does it work for users?"              | Documented credentials           |

**Core rules:**

- No mocking - use dependency injection at Level 1, real dependencies at Level 2+
- Progress tests (may fail) go in `specs/.../tests/`
- Regression tests (must pass) go in `test/` or `tests/`

## TypeScript Plugin

Complete TypeScript development workflow with testing, implementation, and review.

- Three-tier testing: Level 1 (Unit) → Level 2 (Integration) → Level 3 (E2E)
- No mocking: Dependency injection + real infrastructure
- Infrastructure explicit: Test harnesses and credentials documented or tracked as gaps
- User confirmation required: Problem understanding and measurable outcomes
- Quantified value: Measurable outcomes with X% improvement targets

## Discovering Other Installed Skills

## Restrictions on Using `!` Expansion in Commands

````zsh
# Avoid shell operators such as `(N)` (nullglob in zsh)
Error: Bash command permission check failed for pattern "!ls .spx/sessions/TODO_*.md(N) | wc -l | xargs printf "TODO: %s\n" && ls .spx/sessions/DOING_*.md(N) | wc -l | xargs printf "DOING: %s\n"": This command uses shell operators that require approval for safety

# Avoid parameter substitution
Error: Bash command permission check failed for pattern "!for f (.spx/sessions/DOING_*) print mv $f ${f/DOING/TODO}": Command contains ${} parameter substitution

# Avoid loops
Error: Bash command permission check failed for pattern "!find .spx/sessions -maxdepth 1 -name 'DOING_*' | while read f; do echo mv "$f" "$(echo "$f" | sed 's/DOING/TODO/')"; done": This Bash command contains multiple operations. The following part requires approval: while read f ;
     do echo mv "$f" "$(echo "$f" | sed ''s/DOING/TODO/'')" ; done

Error: Bash command permission check failed for pattern "!find .spx/sessions -maxdepth 1 -name 'DOING_*' | awk '{new=$0; sub(/DOING/,"TODO",new); print "mv "$0" "new}'": This Bash command contains multiple operations. The following part requires approval: awk '{new=$0;
     sub(/DOING/,""TODO"",new); print ""mv ""$0"" ""new}'
```

## For AI Agents Modifying This Marketplace

### ⛔ Path Restrictions

**NEVER write to these locations:**

- `.claude/` - Requires user permission for every operation, breaks workflow
- `~/.claude/` - User home directory, not project-specific
- Any path containing `.claude` in user home

**ALWAYS write to project directories:**

- `plugins/` - Plugin code, skills, commands, templates
- `specs/` - Work items, requirements, decisions (see [specs/CLAUDE.md](specs/CLAUDE.md))
- `.spx/` - Tool operational files (sessions, cache) - gitignored
- Project root - Package files, config files

**Rationale:** Claude Code requires user permission for every file operation in `.claude/` directories. This creates friction and breaks the development flow. All project artifacts belong in the project directory structure.

### Before Making Changes

1. **Read the context**: Check [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md:1) (this file) for current structure and versioning rules
2. **Check existing commands**: Use Glob to find existing `.md` files in `plugins/*/commands/`
3. **Review plugin structure**: Each plugin has its own `plugin.json` in `.claude-plugin/`

### After Adding/Modifying Commands or Skills

**Determine version bump type** (see [Version Management](#version-management) above):

- **MAJOR** (0.x.x → 1.x.x): ⛔ NEVER unless user explicitly requests
- **MINOR** (0.3.x → 0.4.x): New command/skill OR major functional change
- **PATCH** (0.3.x → 0.3.1): Bug fixes, refactoring, small changes (MOST COMMON)

**Update plugin.json**:

```bash
# Location: plugins/{plugin-name}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
# Update "version" field according to rules above
````

**Update marketplace description** (only if needed):

```bash
# Location: .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
# Update description for the modified plugin (only if description changes)
```

**Document changes**: Update this [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md:1) file if adding new commands/skills to the plugin tables

**Validate changes**: Always run validation after making changes:

```bash
claude plugin validate .
```

Fix any validation errors before committing changes.

### Versioning Reminder

**When in doubt:**

- Most changes = PATCH version bump
- New items or major changes = MINOR version bump
- Major version stays at 0.x.x unless user requests otherwise
