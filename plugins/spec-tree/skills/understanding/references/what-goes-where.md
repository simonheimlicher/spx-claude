<overview>

Every artifact in the Spec Tree has a specific purpose. Content placed in the wrong artifact creates confusion and duplication.

| Artifact type    | Purpose                    | Contains                         | Verified by             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |

| **PDR**          | GOVERNS what (product)     | Constraints, product invariants  | Product review          |

</overview>

<adr>

**Purpose:** GOVERNS how things are built. Constrains architecture, not product behavior.

**Contains:**

- Purpose — what concern this decision governs
- Context — business impact and technical constraints
- Decision — the chosen approach in one sentence
- Rationale — why this is right given constraints
- Trade-offs accepted — what was given up and why
- Invariants — algebraic properties that must hold
- Compliance — executable verification criteria (MUST / NEVER rules)

**Does NOT contain:** Outcomes, assertions, test references, or implementation code.

**Verified by:** Architecture review skills (e.g., `/reviewing-typescript-architecture`).

</adr>

<pdr>

**Purpose:** GOVERNS what the product does. Establishes product constraints that must hold across a subtree.

**Contains:**

- Purpose — what product behavior this decision governs
- Context — business impact and technical constraints
- Decision — the chosen approach in one sentence
- Rationale — why this is right for users
- Trade-offs accepted — what was given up and why
- Product invariants — observable behaviors users can always rely on
- Compliance — product behavior validation criteria (MUST / NEVER rules)

**Does NOT contain:** Outcomes, assertions, test references, or implementation code.

**Verified by:** Product/UX review.

</pdr>

<enabler_spec>

**Purpose:** DESCRIBES what infrastructure this node provides to its dependents.

**Contains:**

- What this enabler provides and why dependents need it
- Assertions specifying output — what must be true about this infrastructure

**Does NOT contain:** Outcome hypotheses, user behavior claims.

</enabler_spec>

<outcome_spec>

**Purpose:** DESCRIBES a hypothesis connecting a testable output to user behavior change and business impact.

**Contains:**

- Three-part hypothesis: WE BELIEVE THAT [output] WILL [outcome] CONTRIBUTING TO [impact]
- Assertions specifying the output — locally verifiable by tests or review

**Does NOT contain:** Architecture decisions (→ ADR), product constraints (→ PDR), implementation details.

</outcome_spec>

<test_files>

**Purpose:** PROVES that assertions hold.

**Contains:** Test code organized by level:

| Level       | Suffix                    | Question                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Unit        | `.unit.test.{ext}`        | Is our logic correct?                |
| Integration | `.integration.test.{ext}` | Does it work with real dependencies? |
| E2E         | `.e2e.test.{ext}`         | Does it work for users?              |

**Does NOT contain:** Spec content, decision rationale, or anything other than test code.

</test_files>

<lock_file>

**Purpose:** RECORDS that spec and tests were in agreement at the time of writing.

**Contains:** Git blob hashes for the spec file and each test file.

**Does NOT contain:** Test results, timestamps, or any mutable state.

**Written by:** `spx lock` (only when all tests pass).
