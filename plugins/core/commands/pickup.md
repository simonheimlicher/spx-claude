## Current Context

**Git status:**
!`git status --short || echo "Not in a git repo"`

**Available sessions:**
!`find .spx/sessions/todo -name '*.md' -type f 2>/dev/null | sort`

Load a handoff document from `.spx/sessions/todo/` to continue previous work in the current context.

## Session Operations

All session management uses direct filesystem operations — no external CLI required.

### Directory Structure

```
.spx/sessions/
├── todo/      # Available for pickup
├── doing/     # Currently claimed
└── archive/   # Completed
```

### Listing Sessions

```bash
# Todo sessions (available for pickup)
find .spx/sessions/todo -name '*.md' -type f 2>/dev/null | sort

# Doing sessions (currently claimed)
find .spx/sessions/doing -name '*.md' -type f 2>/dev/null | sort
```

### Claiming a Session

```bash
# Move from todo to doing (use -i to avoid clobbering)
mkdir -p .spx/sessions/doing
mv -i .spx/sessions/todo/<session-id>.md .spx/sessions/doing/<session-id>.md
```

### Reading Session Content

Use the **Read** tool on the session file to view its content.

## Behavior

### Default (no arguments)

Claim and load the **highest priority** (or oldest if same priority) session.

### With `--list` flag

Check if `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--list` to activate list mode.

Present all available todo sessions and use `AskUserQuestion` tool to let the user select which one to load.

## Workflow

### 1. Find Available Sessions

Use Glob to find all todo sessions:

```
Glob: .spx/sessions/todo/*.md
```

If no sessions found, report "No handoff sessions found" and suggest using `/handoff`.

### 2a. Default Mode (auto-claim)

1. **Read each todo session** to extract priority from YAML frontmatter:
   - Look for `priority:` in the `---` frontmatter block
   - Priority values: `high`, `medium`, `low` (default: `medium`)

2. **Select the best session**:
   - Sort by priority: `high` > `medium` > `low`
   - Within same priority, pick the oldest (earliest timestamp in filename)

3. **Claim the session** by moving it to `doing/`:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .spx/sessions/doing
   mv -i .spx/sessions/todo/<session-id>.md .spx/sessions/doing/<session-id>.md
   ```

4. **Emit the pickup marker** for `/handoff` to find later:
   `<PICKUP_ID><session-id></PICKUP_ID>`

5. **Read the claimed session** using the Read tool on `.spx/sessions/doing/<session-id>.md`

6. **Present formatted summary** including:
   - Metadata (timestamp, branch, project)
   - Original task
   - Work remaining
   - Note that this session has been claimed for this conversation

7. **Offer to read files** mentioned in the handoff if they exist

### 2b. List Mode (`--list` flag)

1. **Find all todo sessions** using Glob: `.spx/sessions/todo/*.md`

2. **Read each session** to extract:
   - Session ID from filename (e.g., `2026-01-08_16-30-22`)
   - Priority and tags from YAML frontmatter
   - Original task from `<original_task>` section

3. **Use `AskUserQuestion` tool** to present options:
   - **Question**: "Which handoff would you like to load?"
   - **Header**: "Handoff"
   - **Options**: Each session with format:
     - **Label**: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM [priority] (tags)`
     - **Description**: First 100 chars of original task

Example `AskUserQuestion` call:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "Which handoff would you like to load?",
      "header": "Handoff",
      "multiSelect": false,
      "options": [
        {
          "label": "2026-01-08 16:30 [high] (refactor)",
          "description": "Implement /handoff and /pickup commands for context preservation"
        },
        {
          "label": "2026-01-08 14:15 [medium] (auth)",
          "description": "Add OAuth2 authentication flow with token refresh"
        },
        {
          "label": "2026-01-07 22:45 [low]",
          "description": "Debug performance issues in API gateway"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

4. **Claim the selected session**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .spx/sessions/doing
   mv -i .spx/sessions/todo/<selected-session-id>.md .spx/sessions/doing/<selected-session-id>.md
   ```

5. **Emit the pickup marker**: `<PICKUP_ID><session-id></PICKUP_ID>`

6. **Present the claimed session content**

### 3. Present Handoff Content

Format the handoff in a clear, readable way:

```markdown
# Handoff: [Session ID]

**Project**: [project name]
**Branch**: [branch name]
**Status**: [git status]
**Priority**: [priority]
**Tags**: [tags]

## Original Task

[Original task description]

## Work Completed

[Summary of completed work]

## Work Remaining

[List of remaining tasks]

## Attempted Approaches

[Failed approaches and learnings]

## Critical Context

[Important context to preserve]

## Current State

[Current state of deliverables]
```

### 4. Offer Next Steps

After presenting the handoff, use the `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user:

- "Would you like me to read any files mentioned in the handoff?"
- "Should I continue with the work remaining?"
- "Do you want to modify the plan?"

---

## Error Handling

**No sessions directory or empty**:

```
No handoff sessions found in .spx/sessions/todo/
Use `/handoff` to create a handoff document.
```

**Only doing sessions exist**:

```
Found only doing sessions — these are claimed by active sessions.
```

List doing sessions:

```bash
find .spx/sessions/doing -name '*.md' -type f 2>/dev/null | sort
```

Present options via `AskUserQuestion`:

- Wait for other sessions to complete
- Check if doing sessions are orphaned (from abandoned sessions)

**Invalid session format**:

```
Warning: Session [id] appears to be corrupted or incomplete.
Showing raw content:
```

Read the file directly with the Read tool.

## Examples

### Load highest priority session

```bash
/pickup
```

### Select from list

```bash
/pickup --list
```

## Implementation Notes

- Session IDs use format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`
- Sessions organized in subdirectories: `todo/`, `doing/`, `archive/`
- Extract sections using XML tags: `<metadata>`, `<original_task>`, etc.
- Handle missing sections gracefully
- Priority order: high > medium > low (oldest first within same priority)
- Limit list to most recent 10 sessions to keep UI manageable
- POSIX `mv` is atomic at the filesystem level — safe for parallel agents

## Self-Organizing Handoff System

This command works with `/handoff` to create a self-organizing handoff workflow:

**The Claim Mechanism:**

1. `/pickup` claims a session by moving it from `todo/` to `doing/`
2. POSIX `mv` is atomic — only one agent can successfully claim each session
3. Agent works on the claimed session throughout the conversation

**Automatic Cleanup:**

- When the session ends with `/handoff`, it:
  - Creates a new session in `todo/`
  - Archives the `doing/` session (superseded by new handoff)
  - Leaves only available `todo/` sessions

**Parallel Agent Safety:**

- Multiple agents can run `/pickup` simultaneously
- `mv -i` prevents clobbering if two agents race for the same session
- Priority-based selection with FIFO within same priority
- No duplicate work

**Visual Status:**

- `todo/*.md` = Available for pickup
- `doing/*.md` = Currently being worked on
- `archive/*.md` = Completed
